# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Blogr landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

This challenge mostly focuses on HTML & CSS. The only JavaScript required is for the mobile menu.

Your users should be able to:

    View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
